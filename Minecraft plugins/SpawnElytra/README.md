# SpawnElytra
This plugin enables you to have a spawn Elytra within a range from 20 blockks from the worldspawn

# What is a spawn Elytra
Spawn Elytra means, that even if you don't have an actual Elytra you're able to fly like you have one. But if you aren't within the 20 block range you cannot activate it.
